Evaporimeter, a scientific device is used to measure the rate of water evaporation into the atmosphere from a wet surface. Using this instrument, we are able to calculate irrigation scheduling, crop selection to the different geographical area and future prediction of drought. Nowaday's the compressive development of wireless sensor and Internet of things (loT) can be embedded with manually operated evaporimeter. By deploying different types of sensors on manually operated evaporimeter and exchange data with servers is not only reduce the manual effort but also feasible it for real-time remote area operation. Here we have built the design of low- cost sensory evaporimeter based on loT.
